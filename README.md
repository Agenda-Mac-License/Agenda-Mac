## Overview

<a href="#">Agenda for macOS</a> organises notes around dates so that each entry fits into the story of a project’s timeline. Instead of a flat list of documents, you see items attached to calendar events, milestones and periods of focus. Meeting notes live where the meetings happened; planning documents sit near the dates when decisions were made. This structure makes it easier to reconstruct how work unfolded and why particular choices were taken at specific times.

Notes in Agenda can contain styled text, attachments, checklists and <a href="#">linked references</a> to other entries. Projects group related notes together while overviews and filters help surface items that need attention today or in the near future. Integration with the calendar and reminders on macOS means you can jump from a scheduled event into its corresponding notes with a single click. For ongoing initiatives, this keeps preparation, discussion and follow-up tied tightly together, reducing the risk of action items getting lost.

On macOS, Agenda sits comfortably alongside mail clients, task managers and browsers. It shines when used as the narrative layer on top of more transactional tools, providing a coherent record of conversations, drafts and outcomes. Over time, it becomes the living journal of your professional work, revealing not just what you did, but when and in response to what.
